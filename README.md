## perspeen
This is a package for GNU Emacs in order to make it much more  convenient to work with multiple workspaces simultaneously.

## The History
Before using Emacs, I am a vimer and my coding work flow is `iTerms` + `Zsh` + `Tmux` + `Vim`.  I often open multiple tmux windows. Each window
is an workspace,  splitted with at least two panes; one pane runs `macvim`, and another pane below runs `zsh`. Each window has its own workspace.

## Why named perspeen
This package is inspired from [perspective](https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el) and [elscreen](https://github.com/knu/elscreen). `perspective` is 
good, but it has not tab-persist.  This package, `perspeen`, is intended to combine both `perspective` and `elscreen`. Make the workspace has the tab-persist feature.
So the name is also combined from these two package names. `persp-een`.

## Install and config

2. Using [el-get](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get)
